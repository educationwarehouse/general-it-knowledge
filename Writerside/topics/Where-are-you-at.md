This course is meant to be a guide to help you to become an expert in IT, or at least to help you to become skilled
enough
to be able to follow a course at a university or to be able to work in IT. The same goes for interns: a company will
assume that you have the basic skills to be able to work in IT. This course will help you to get those skills.

## Learning Path

We have tried to create a learning path based on the following principles:

* Sequential: Each higher-level subject should build upon the knowledge of the preceding levels.
* Subject Continuity: Topics within each subject should be logically ordered and coherent.
* Prerequisite Checks: Higher-level topics should not introduce concepts that are taught in detail at a later stage.
